# Samuel Stark MPhil End-of-year Presentation

This is the LuaTeX source code for my MPhil thesis. It compiles on TeX Live 2021, and has not been tested on other versions.

It uses some of my custom packages from [latex-turnip-pkgs](https://github.com/theturboturnip/latex-turnip-pkgs), as well as some that haven't been moved over yet.

It is uses Beamer with a custom color scheme for the Metropolis theme.
